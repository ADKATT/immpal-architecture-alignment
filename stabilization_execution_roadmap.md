# IMMPAL – Stabilization & Execution Roadmap  
_Audit Phase – Controlled Structural Realignment_

---

## 1. Scope

This roadmap defines the ordered stabilization sequence required to align the current implementation with the confirmed architectural baseline.

It is derived directly from:

- Architecture Alignment Document
- Implementation Alignment Report
- Structural Gap Log
- Risk Severity Table

This document does not introduce new architectural principles.

It defines controlled structural enforcement before any feature expansion.

---

## 2. Execution Philosophy

IMMPAL is a governance-driven system.

Therefore:

1. Authority enforcement precedes feature velocity.
2. Structural integrity precedes module expansion.
3. Deterministic lifecycle control precedes automation.
4. Abstraction enforcement precedes jurisdiction scaling.

No expansion should occur on unstable structural boundaries.

---

## 3. Stabilization Strategy Overview

Stabilization follows a risk-first sequence:

1. Secure lifecycle authority.
2. Consolidate rule integrity.
3. Harden module boundaries.
4. Reinforce concurrency control.
5. Validate ecosystem activation governance.

Each phase must complete structural validation before moving forward.

## 4. Stabilization Priority Matrix

| Priority | Structural Area | Risk Level | Dependency | Effort Band | Source (Gap / Risk ID) |
|----------|----------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| P1 | Lifecycle authority centralization | Critical | None | Medium | G-XX / R-XX |
| P2 | Rule extraction & Library normalization | High | P1 | Medium | G-XX |
| P3 | Module boundary hardening | High | P1 | Low–Medium | G-XX |
| P4 | Entitlement enforcement isolation | Medium | P1 | Low | G-XX |
| P5 | Ecosystem activation governance validation | Medium | P1, P3 | Low | G-XX |
| P6 | Concurrency & case exclusivity safeguards | High | P1 | Medium | G-XX |

Priority Definitions:

- P1 = Structural blocker  
- P2 = Governance integrity requirement  
- P3 = Authority boundary reinforcement  
- P4 = Entitlement isolation enforcement  
- P5 = Controlled expansion validation  
- P6 = Deterministic safety reinforcement

## 5. Phase-Based Execution Plan

### Phase 1 – Lifecycle Authority Stabilization

Objective:
- Centralize all state transitions within CaseEngine
- Eliminate direct lifecycle mutation
- Enforce deterministic progression model

Validation Criteria:
- No state change outside CaseEngine
- Transition map documented and validated
- Unauthorized mutation attempts blocked

Output:
- Lifecycle authority secured
- Transition enforcement verified

---

### Phase 2 – Library Rule Integrity Consolidation

Objective:
- Extract rule duplication
- Enforce Library as sole rule authority
- Remove embedded country/program logic from core modules

Validation Criteria:
- No rule execution outside Library
- No jurisdiction-specific branching in CaseEngine
- Versioned rule consumption confirmed

Output:
- Normalized rule execution
- Program abstraction preserved

---

### Phase 3 – Module Boundary Hardening

Objective:
- Enforce separation between:
  - CaseEngine
  - Business Layer
  - Ecosystem modules
- Remove entitlement-driven lifecycle mutation paths

Validation Criteria:
- Business Layer cannot influence lifecycle
- Ecosystem modules cannot mutate case state
- Clear interface contracts defined

Output:
- Clean authority separation
- Governance boundary clarity

---

### Phase 4 – Concurrency & Case Exclusivity Reinforcement

Objective:
- Prevent parallel lifecycle mutation
- Enforce case-level locking
- Validate transaction safety

Validation Criteria:
- No concurrent state mutation possible
- Transaction isolation enforced
- Race conditions mitigated

Output:
- Deterministic lifecycle execution
- Case exclusivity guaranteed

---

### Phase 5 – Ecosystem Activation Governance Validation

Objective:
- Validate activation through:
  1. Savy (gap detection)
  2. BrainReport CTAs
  3. Direct client activation (with prerequisites)

Validation Criteria:
- BrainReport required before ecosystem activation
- Profile completion validated
- Entitlement gating enforced
- No independent ecosystem execution allowed

Output:
- Controlled ecosystem expansion
- Governance-compliant activation paths

---

## 6. Reuse vs Refactor vs Replace Strategy

Classification is derived from Implementation Alignment Report.

| Component | Classification | Structural Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Authentication | Reuse | Not lifecycle-sensitive |
| Intake Layer | Refactor | Boundary tightening required |
| Case Lifecycle | Refactor / Harden | Authority enforcement needed |
| Rule Logic | Consolidate | Normalize into Library |
| Ecosystem Modules | Validate | Enforce activation gating |

Refactor does not imply rebuild.
It implies structural realignment for compliance.

---

## 7. Execution Control Rules

During stabilization:

- No new feature development
- No ecosystem module expansion
- No jurisdiction scaling
- No UI-driven structural changes

Until:

- Lifecycle authority secured
- Rule-source integrity confirmed
- Concurrency safety validated
- Boundary enforcement verified

---

## 8. Completion Criteria

Stabilization is considered complete when:

- All Critical and High gaps resolved
- No lifecycle mutation outside CaseEngine
- No rule duplication outside Library
- Business Layer isolated from lifecycle authority
- Ecosystem activation fully governed
- Case exclusivity enforced

Only then can structured expansion proceed.

---

## 9. Conclusion

This roadmap ensures:

- Governance-first stabilization
- Risk-prioritized sequencing
- Deterministic lifecycle enforcement
- Program-agnostic scalability
- Safe ecosystem expansion

IMMPAL stabilization is not feature work.
It is structural reinforcement.

Feature development should resume only after structural compliance is achieved.
