# IMMPAL – Architecture & Alignment Audit Phase

## Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for the Architecture & Alignment Audit Phase of IMMPAL.

The objective of this phase is to validate the current implementation against the formally defined architectural baseline and governance framework.

This phase does not redefine architecture.  
It evaluates structural alignment and identifies stabilization priorities.

---

## Scope of This Audit

The audit focuses on:

- Validation of implementation against documented module responsibilities
- Enforcement of CaseEngine lifecycle authority
- Verification of Library as the canonical and versioned source of truth
- Confirmation of Business Layer entitlement separation
- Core vs Ecosystem module boundary validation
- Country-agnostic and program-agnostic compliance
- Governance and change-control adherence

---

## Deliverables

1. `architecture_alignment_document.md`  
   Formal confirmation of architectural boundaries and enforcement model.

2. `implementation_alignment_report.md`  
   Structured evaluation of the current implementation against the architectural baseline.

3. `stabilization_execution_roadmap.md`  
   Practical and prioritized roadmap for structural hardening and controlled execution.

## Guiding Principles

- No architectural principles are redefined in this phase.
- The objective is alignment, not reconstruction.
- Structurally sound components should be preserved.
- Structural risks must be identified early.
- Implementation must remain governed and deterministic.

## Status

Audit phase initiated under formal engagement.  
All findings and recommendations are contained within the referenced documents.
